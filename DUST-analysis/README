This folder contains the entire DUST project connected to "Progetto Aerodinamico AA2023/24"

The project is composed by different analysis and parts all divided.
In this document the organization of the different subfolder is presented:
	- sensitivity-box:	input, output and post process DUST file for "box length" sensitivity analysis (see DUST_user_manual user guide and DUST_paper_reference)
	- sensitivity-gap:	input, output and post process DUST file for "gap" sensitivity analysis (gap between wing and fuselage that modelize the connection)
	- sensitivity-mesh:	input, output and post process DUST file for "mesh" sensitivity analysis (see DUST_user_manual user guide and DUST_paper_reference)
	- src:			all matlab function produced and used in this project




| SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS PACK |

Using this MATLAB + DUST project can be tested different mesh and configuration to solve wing+fuselage configuration
Each sensitivity analysis consider as data the integral loads of the wing (in particular Cz and Cm).
For each output the time cost in term of CPU time is computed using MATLAB function 'tic' 'toc' (results may be different by changing hardware)

The scope of this analysis is to define the ideal configuration to run an iterative study to design LERX of the wing+fuselage configuration considered
For each sensitivity analysis the corresponding script enters in the correct folder and operate the following procedure:
	1) writes all the needed input files inside the folder ">/sensitivity-X/input-DUST/.."
	2) execute DUST in the folder ">/sensitivity-X/input-DUST/.." using the settings prepared in step 1
	3) saves all the output files in the folder ">/sensitivity-X/output-DUST/.."
	4) saves all the post process files in the folder ">/sensitivity-X/pp-DUST/.."
	5) import the integral loads of all the simulation in matlab
	6) post-process all the data imported and produce some nice plots showing the results
	7) repeat the procedure for the next sensitivity analysis
