# M03_aoaX_symConfig_leftWing #
Means that the DUST run has been done considering a symmetric wing geometry BUT loads and visual has been done only on half a wing.
In this way the results allign with the half wing domain of the Euler CFD with SU2.
Reference Values has been retrived from the output file of SU2 and has been set in Dust.in
The following variables has been considered:
	rho  = 1.22498	kg/m^3	density
	v    = 102.089	m/s	abs velocity
	a    = 340.2966	m/s	speed of sound	-->	computed to match Ma=0.3
	L    = 1.0000	m	ref chord
	S    = 0.7586	m^2	ref surface
	Pref = 12767 	Pa	ref pressure
	mu   = ?

	
# M03_aoaX_leftConfig_leftWing #
Means that the DUST run has been done considering only left wing... This causes some difference between DUST and CFD results.
In this way the results DON'T allign with the half wing domain of the Euler CFD with SU2.
