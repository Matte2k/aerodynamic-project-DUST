## WARNING ##

In the current version of the code the post-processor is lunched one time and execute all the analysis in order
Due to this achitectural approach there are some limitation on the different configuration testable

In particular when the tail is disabled:	TAIL0
the leading edge vortex modelized as a LL cannot be used

Future release and refactor will fix this issue and will allow for a full parametric study of the aircraft
